# AWS-Cloud-Cost-Optimization
The lambda function designed to spot EBS snapshots devoid of any linkage to active EC2 instances. The function then proceeds to eradicate these snapshots, resulting in reduced storage expenditures.
This Lambda function retrieves all EBS snapshots owned by the account and gathers a comprehensive list of active EC2 instances, encompassing both running and stopped instances. Subsequently, for each snapshot, it conducts a validation check to ensure that its corresponding volume, if present, remains disassociated from any active instance. Upon detecting obsolete snapshots, the function initiates their deletion, effectively streamlining storage costs.
